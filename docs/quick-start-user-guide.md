  <div>

Welcome to **Census Galaxy** — a fast, clean, and powerful way to explore U.S. Census geography and demographics.

### Choose your geography level
- **Block Group** or **Tract**: high-resolution analysis like local targeting or equity metrics.
- **ZIP Code** or **County**: for regional summaries or matching to marketing/consumer datasets.

### Use percentages and percentiles appropriately
- **Percentages** (e.g., % Black, % College Degree): describe characteristics within a population.
- **Percentiles** (e.g., income percentile = 0.92): rank a geography relative to others (nationally or within state).

### Visualize polygons easily
Every row includes **GeoJSON fields** for polygons and centroids, usable with:
- Mapbox, Kepler.gl, GIS tools
- Custom dashboards (Deck.gl, Leaflet)
- Analytics workflows in Python, R, Tableau, Power BI

### Data is updated annually
- Uses latest **ACS 5-Year Estimates** and boundaries.
- Each release is timestamped and versioned.

### Integrate into knowledge workflows
- Upload datasets into a **vector database** or GPT knowledge base for search, summarization, and Q&A.

### Annual Refresh & Versioning
- Synced with **ACS 5-Year Estimates**.
- **ZIP Codes** use USPS definitions via HUD crosswalk (40k valid ZIPs).

### Using Polygons and Coordinates
- Includes **GeoJSON polygon** and **centroid point**.
- Separate latitude/longitude for fast mapping.
- Compatible with GIS, dashboards, geofencing, and spatial joins.

### Percentages vs Percentiles
| Metric Type | Example | Use Case |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| Percentage  | 22.5% with Bachelor's degree | Understanding composition |
| Percentile  | Income percentile = 0.91     | Comparing rankings |

- Use **percentages** for internal composition.
- Use **percentiles** for comparisons.

### Uploading to Knowledge Base
- Data is standardized for AI tools.
- Upload to **Pinecone**, **Weaviate**, or **Supabase pgvector**.
- Enable GPT-powered Q&A, semantic search, and dashboards.
