# Quick Start Guide

Welcome to **Census Galaxy** — a fast, clean, and powerful way to explore U.S. Census geography and demographics.

## Choose your geography level
- **Block Group** or **Tract**: high-resolution analysis like local targeting or equity metrics.
- **ZIP Code** or **County**: for regional summaries or matching to marketing/consumer datasets.

## Use percentages and percentiles appropriately
- **Percentages** (e.g., % Black, % College Degree): describe characteristics within a population.
- **Percentiles** (e.g., income percentile = 0.92): rank a geography relative to others (nationally or within state).

## Visualize polygons easily
Every row includes **GeoJSON fields** for polygons and centroids, usable with:
- Mapbox, Kepler.gl, GIS tools
- Custom dashboards (Deck.gl, Leaflet)
- Analytics workflows in Python, R, Tableau, Power BI

## Data is updated annually
- Uses latest **ACS 5-Year Estimates** and boundaries.
- Each release is timestamped and versioned.

## Integrate into knowledge workflows
Upload datasets into a **vector database** or GPT knowledge base for search, summarization, and Q&A.
