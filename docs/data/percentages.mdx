## Percentages

The Percentages table shows what portion of a population in a given area has a specific characteristic. A value of 0.41 for degree holders means that 41% of adults aged 25+ in that geography have a college degree.

> ðŸŸ¡ **Note**: Percentages are calculated using a relevant denominator â€” like Total Population, Households, or Adults 25+ â€” as shown in the data dictionary table.

### Use when:
- You want to describe the makeup of a population (e.g., % female, % foreign born).
- Youâ€™re filtering based on specific thresholds (e.g., ZIPs where over 60% have internet access).
- Youâ€™re building charts or dashboards that show absolute values.
- Youâ€™re analyzing traits within a geography, not comparing it to others.
