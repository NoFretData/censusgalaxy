## Percentiles

The **Percentiles** table ranks each geography relative to all geographies in the nation â€” not just within its state.  
A percentile of `0.92` means that the area scores higher than 92% of all U.S. geographies for that metric.

> ðŸŸ¡ **Note**: Percentiles are always calculated against **national distributions**  
> (e.g., all block groups in the U.S.), not within a specific state or county.

### Use when:
- You want to highlight top/bottom performers (e.g., bottom 10% of income).
- Youâ€™re building equity dashboards or identifying priority zones.
- You need filters for visualizations (e.g., show only tracts below the 25th percentile).
- Youâ€™re creating models or indexes that require standardized, relative values. -->

## Percentages

The Percentages table shows what portion of a population in a given area has a specific characteristic. A value of 0.41 for degree holders means that 41% of adults aged 25+ in that geography have a college degree.

> ðŸŸ¡ **Note**: Percentages are calculated using a relevant denominator â€” like Total Population, Households, or Adults 25+ â€” as shown in the data dictionary table.

### Use when:
- You want to describe the makeup of a population (e.g., % female, % foreign born).
- Youâ€™re filtering based on specific thresholds (e.g., ZIPs where over 60% have internet access).
- Youâ€™re building charts or dashboards that show absolute values.
- Youâ€™re analyzing traits within a geography, not comparing it to others.
