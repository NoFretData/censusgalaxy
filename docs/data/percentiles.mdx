## Percentiles

The **Percentiles** table ranks each geography relative to all geographies in the nation â€” not just within its state.  
A percentile of `0.92` means that area scores higher than 92% of all U.S. geographies for that metric.

> ðŸŸ¡ **Note**: Percentiles are always calculated against **national distributions** (e.g., all block groups in the U.S.), not within a state or county.

### Use when:
- You want to highlight top/bottom performers (e.g., bottom 10% of income).
- Youâ€™re building equity dashboards or identifying priority zones.
- You need filters for visualizations (e.g., show only tracts below the 25th percentile).
- Youâ€™re creating models or indexes that require standardized, relative values.
